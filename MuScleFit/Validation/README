INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE VALIDATION
##################################

!!!! IMPORTANT: set up Roofit by issuing:
	source RootSetup.sh  !!!!

In order to run the validation you can use the script:
./runDiMuonValidation.py -h (to see the options)

Example:
./runDiMuonValidation.py -d foo -z -j -y -q
(runs on all the 3 resonances in quiet mode)

The output will be stored in the directory specified with the "-d" option.

Before launching the script you have to set up the path to the trees and the text files
with the correction parameters in TreePath.py (default is provided for 2012 ReReco validation).

The validation can be also run step-by-step, following the instructions below:

1. prepare the .cfg file with path to tree and text files (see examples provided)
2. gmake clean; gmake all
3. ./validate <my-cfg>.cfg
4. histograms files are stored in $TMPDIR directory: 
   hadd h3_afterCorrection.root `ls $TMPDIR/h3_*afterCorrection.root` 
   (eventually: hadd h3_beforeCorrection.root `ls $TMPDIR/h3_*beforeCorrection.root` )
5. set up RooFit on lxplus (eventually changing ROOT and gcc version editing the script):
   ./RootSetup.sh	
6. root -b -q -l "Fitter.C+(\"h3_afterCorrection.root\",\"TGEs_afterCorrection.root\",\"_afterCorrection\")"
7. root -b -q -l "Plotter.C+(\"TGEs_afterCorrection.root\",\"_afterCorrection\")"

Enjoy!
